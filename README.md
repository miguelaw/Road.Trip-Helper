## Demo

The demo of this application can be found [here](https://miguelaw.github.io/Road.Trip-Helper/).


## Project Details:

This app is a trip planner that uses Google Places, Google Map & OpenWeather Apis to generate the results based on the User Input. Also, the data inputted by the user will get stored on a dedicated Firebase Database. (This data will be used for research purposes and also allow other companies to find out which are the most common destinations).

Additionally, we have created a fully functional "pseudo" company website to go along with the project. This website includes the usage of multiple .css libraries like animate.css, bootstrap.css, as well as user input authentication, etc. We have also created a company email to reply any comments left to us through our contact us section.

If you feel creative please leave us a comment, and we'll get back to you soon!
